        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          If you've been using another course management system, you probably have stuff in there
          that you're going to want moved over to Canvas.  We can walk you through
          the process of easily migrating your content into Canvas.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="option assignments_step <%= 'completed' unless @context.assignments.active.empty? %>">
        <a href="<%= context_url(@context, :context_assignments_url, :wizard => 1) %>" class="header">Add Course Assignments</a>
        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          Add your assignments.  You can just make a long list, or break them up
          into groups -- and even specify weights for each assignment group.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="option <%=  'completed' unless @context.students.empty? %>">

        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          You'll definitely want some of these.  What's the fun of teaching a course
          if nobody's even listening?
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="option download_step <%= 'completed' unless @context.attachments.active.empty? %>" style="display: none;">

        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          The Files tab is the place to share lecture slides, example documents, study helps -- 
          anything your students will want to download.  Uploading and organizing your files
          is easy with Canvas.  We'll show you how.

        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          By default all links are enabled for a course.  Students won't see
          links to sections that don't have content.  For example, if you haven't
          created any quizzes, they won't see the quizzes link.  You can sort and
          explicitly disable these links if there are areas of the course you don't
          want your students accessing.

      <li class="option content_step completed">
        <a href="#" class="header">Choose a Course Home Page</a>
        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          When people visit the course, this is the page they'll see.  You can set
          it to show an activity stream, the list of course modules, a syllabus,
          or a custom page you write yourself.  The default is the course
          activity stream.  To customize this, just click
          <strong class="change_home_page_layout_indicate">Change Home Page Layout</strong>.

        <a href="<%= calendar_path(:wizard => 1) %>" class="header">Add Course Calendar Events</a>
        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          Here's a great chance to get to know the calendar -- and add
          any non-assignment events you might have to the course.  Don't worry,
          we'll help you through it.

        <div class="details" style="display: none;">
          You may want to assign some TA's to help you with the course.  TA's
          can grade student submissions, help moderate the discussions and even update
          due dates and assignment details for you.
