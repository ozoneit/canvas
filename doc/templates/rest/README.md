Welcome to the Canvas LMS API Documentation
===========================================

Canvas LMS includes a REST API for accessing and modifying data
externally from the main application, in your own programs and scripts.

The API is currently under rapid development and many areas of the
application are still unavailable via the external API, but you can get
started on what's there today by learning the Basics and then viewing
information on the exposed Resource types.
