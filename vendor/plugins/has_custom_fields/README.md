# has\_custom\_fields

Allows adding custom fields to any ActiveRecord model, without modifying that
class' database table. You can also scope the fields in a pretty flexible
manner, for instance if you only want to add a field to User instances in a
specific Account instance.

This plugin is intended to be a separate project from Canvas, but it's not
mature enough at this point for an independent release. So for now it lives in
the Canvas repo.
